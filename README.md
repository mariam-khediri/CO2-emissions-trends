# 🌍 Analyzing Global CO₂ Emissions Trends

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to explore, visualize, and model global **CO₂ emissions trends** using publicly available data. It walks through the full data analysis lifecycle, from **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to building an interactive **dashboard** and implementing **machine learning models** for CO₂ prediction.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand **global and country-specific** CO₂ emission patterns.
- Identify **top emitters** and **emission inequalities**.
- Explore the **relationship between GDP, population, and emissions**.
- Highlight **success stories** of countries reducing emissions.
- Develop a **dashboard** for interactive data exploration.
- Build and compare **regression models** to predict future emissions.
