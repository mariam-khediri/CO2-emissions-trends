# CO2-emissions-trends
In this project we will explore , analyse and visualise trends in global CO2 emission using real world data
1. understanding the data
- data available in the following link: https://github.com/owid/co2-data
2. analysing trends:
- how have global CO2 emissions changed over time?
- which countries emit the most/least CO2?
- are emissions increasing or decreasing in specific regions?
- what's the relationship between CO2 and population or GDP ?
3. visualising insights
4. drawing insights
- summarize key takeaways and highlight any surprising patterns
5. feature engineering 
- build general purpose features
6. Tunisia mini case 
- study tunisia's co2 emission trends over time , the contributing factors
- how it compares regionally and globally
- when did tunisia emit the most co2?
- how did population , gdp and emissions relate?
- has there been any improvement in efficiency/ is there less co2 per gdp?
- is tunisia doing better or worse than its neighbors?
